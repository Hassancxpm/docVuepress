If any of the clauses in these Account GTCU is declared null or inapplicable by virtue of a law, regulation or judicial decision issued by a competent court, the other clauses preserve their validity and effect. 11.2. The fact that Comexposium does not demand the application of any clause in the Account GTCU, whether permanently or temporarily, may not under any circumstances be interpreted as a renunciation of any of its rights arising from this clause. ARTICLE 12 - APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION 12.1. These Account GTCU are governed by French law. Any translation of these Account GTCU into English or any other language is provided by Comexposium for convenience only. In the event of any inconsistency or contradiction between the French version and a translated version, whatever the language of the translation, the French version takes precedence. 12.2. In the event of a dispute, the Parties must make every effort to come to an amicable agreement before applying to any Courts. However, if no amicable solution can be found, the most diligent party can apply to the competent court, if need be the one with jurisdiction in the area where Comexposium's head office is located.</p> <h2 id="cookies-internet-advertising"><a href="#cookies-internet-advertising" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> COOKIES &amp; INTERNET ADVERTISING</h2> <p>I.
